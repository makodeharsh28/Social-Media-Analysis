# Social-Media-Analysis-Project
Overview:
- This project simulates a data analysis workflow for a marketing firm specializing in social media brand promotion. The primary goal is to analyze tweet-like data in various categories (e.g., Health, Family, Food) and generate insights to improve social media performance.
- The project involves data generation, cleaning, visualization, and statistical analysis to uncover patterns in engagement (likes) across different categories.

Dataset Description:

The dataset contains randomly generated data with the following columns:

- Date: The date of the tweet.
- Category: The category of the content (e.g., Food, Travel, Health).
- Likes: The number of likes for the content, ranging from 0 to 10,000.
- Dataset size: 500 records

Note: Since the dataset is randomly created, findings are illustrative and may not reflect real-world data.

Tools Used:
- Python: Programming language for data manipulation and visualization.
- Pandas: For creating and cleaning data frames.
- Numpy: For random data generation.
- Matplotlib & Seaborn: For creating visualizations.
- Jupyter Notebook: For implementing the analysis interactively.

Features:
- Random data generation for tweets (Date, Category, Likes).
- Cleaning and preprocessing the data (e.g., handling null values, duplicates).
- Visualization of data distributions and trends using Matplotlib and Seaborn.
- Statistical analysis to identify key engagement patterns.
